# Reaction_Time_Game
Wakuri and Nicholas Project for Software Engineering

 
 README “How to Run” placeholders: Requirements / Run / Test

 Requirements to Run: Python 3.13.9 / Pygame 2.6.1 / Working keyboard and mouse
 How to run: use run command in the terminal, or click the run button for your IDE
 How we will test: We will test each component of our project individually as we add them
   First: We will test and implement the time function to keep track of when user clicks for test
   Second: We will test our basic graphical interface to make sure user can click each button
   Third: We will test our local leaderboard by seeing if it keeps track of our scores automatically

  Here is the File Structure we anticipate
    main.py - the file that will run our game
    leaderboard.py - the file that will contain the backend code to store our reaction times
    graphical_interface.py - the file that will contain the pygame functions that allow us to have a GUI
    psykit_setup - the file that will contani psykit toolbox functions to control parameter on user device such as frame rate
